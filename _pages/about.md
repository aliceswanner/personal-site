About Me
---

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in German Literature. I am passionate about research and teaching, with a particular focus on making computer science a more inclusive and accessible field for individuals of all identities. My interests lie in machine learning and its diverse applications, including environmental, medical, and social contexts. Currently, I am engaged in research with the [Epstein Ecosystem Ecology Lab](https://epstein.evsc.virginia.edu/) and [Wei-Kai Lin](https://weikailin.github.io/) at UVA.

example for linking

For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
