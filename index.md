<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia</a>, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in German Literature. I am passionate about research and teaching, with a particular focus on making computer science a more inclusive and accessible field for individuals of all identities. My interests lie in machine learning and its diverse applications, including environmental, medical, and social contexts. Currently, I am engaged in research with the <a href="https://epstein.evsc.virginia.edu/">Epstein Ecosystem Ecology Lab</a> and <a href="https://weikailin.github.io/">Wei-Kai Lin</a> at UVA.</p>
